# Design-Patterns

This is personal learning following the Head First Design Patterns book and amazing videos by [Christopher Okhravi](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrhzvIcii6GNjpARdnO4ueTUAVR9eMBpc) and the [Grokking the Object Oriented Desing Inteview](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-object-oriented-design-interview) by educative.io

The repository will contain:

- The examples used in each chapter of the book
- Extension to the examples by Mr. Okhravi
- Case Studies in the Grokking course (Will come after the book)
- Any other example I find interesting to implement.
